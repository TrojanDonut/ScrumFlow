## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (version 20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 2.0+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.30+)

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ScrumFlow
   ```

2. **Start the application using the provided script**
   ```bash
   ./docker-start.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Stop any existing containers
   - Remove dangling containers
   - Build and start the containers with docker-compose

   Alternatively, you can use docker-compose directly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/

### Manual Setup (without Docker)

#### Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

#### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Development

- The Docker setup includes volume mounts, so changes to the code will be reflected in real-time.
- Backend changes will trigger the Django auto-reload.
- Frontend changes will trigger the React hot-reload.

### Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where docker-start.sh is running, or run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

1. **Check container logs**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   docker-compose logs frontend
   ```

2. **Restart the containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Reset the database** (if you have migration issues)
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose run --rm backend rm -f db.sqlite3
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, following a modular approach with separate apps for different domains:

- **users**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management
- **projects**: Manages projects, team members, and project documentation
- **sprints**: Handles sprint planning, tracking, and retrospectives
- **stories**: Manages user stories, acceptance criteria, and estimation
- **tasks**: Handles task creation, assignment, and time tracking

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React, using a component-based architecture:

- **components**: Reusable UI components
- **pages**: Page-level components
- **store**: State management
- **utils**: Utility functions and services for backend communication

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/api/swagger/ when the application is running. It provides detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

## ðŸ”’ Security

The application implements several security measures:

- JWT-based authentication
- Two-factor authentication
- Password validation with minimum length and complexity requirements
- CSRF protection
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
