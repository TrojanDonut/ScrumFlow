## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (version 20.10+)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 2.0+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.30+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scrum-workflow-app.git
   cd scrum-workflow-app
   ```

2. **Build and start the Docker containers**
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker images
   docker-compose build
   
   # Start the containers in detached mode
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Apply database migrations
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
   
   # Create initial test data (users and sample project)
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py create_initial_data
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api)
   - API documentation: [http://localhost:8000/api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/)
   - Admin interface: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

1. **Check container logs**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   docker-compose logs frontend
   ```

2. **Restart the containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Reset the database** (if you have migration issues)
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose run --rm backend rm -f db.sqlite3
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
   docker-compose exec backend python manage.py create_initial_data
   ```

### Default Users

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| admin | admin123 | System Administrator |
| product_owner | password123 | Product Owner |

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, following a modular approach with separate apps for different domains:

- **users**: Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management
- **projects**: Manages projects, team members, and project documentation
- **sprints**: Handles sprint planning, tracking, and retrospectives
- **stories**: Manages user stories, acceptance criteria, and estimation
- **tasks**: Handles task creation, assignment, and time tracking

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and Redux, using a component-based architecture:

- **components**: Reusable UI components
- **pages**: Page-level components
- **store**: Redux store with slices for different data domains
- **services**: API service functions for backend communication

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available at [http://localhost:8000/api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/) when the application is running. It provides detailed information about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

### Running Tests

To run the backend tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test users
```

To run the frontend tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec frontend npm test
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Backend: Modify Django code in the `backend/` directory
   - Frontend: Modify React code in the `frontend/` directory

3. **Test your changes**:
   - Run the tests as described above
   - Manually test the feature in the browser

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** for code review
